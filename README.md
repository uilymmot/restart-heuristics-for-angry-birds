This is the codes associated the paper "Using Restart Heuristics to Improve Agent Performance in Angry Birds" published in the Proceedings of The Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) in London, UK from 20-23rd August 2019. A preprint can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12877.

This is the source code for the restart module (Artefact), the demo AIBIRDS agent (AIBIRDS Framework) and the stability module (P. Zhang).

<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
To run this code the AIBIRDS framework must be installed. Instructions to do so and resources can be found at https://aibirds.org/ Replace the src folder in the AIBIRDS framework with this src folder in order to build the agent and the solvability module

<h2>Privacy</h2>
For privacy and ethical reasons, agent codes which was used to test the solvability module has been excluded from any artefacts. Such codes can be provided on request.
